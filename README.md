# 15.071x - The Analytics Edge - Kaggle Competition
This repository contains the script I used to generate submissions to the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/15-071x-the-analytics-edge-summer-2015) that was part of the Summer 2015 edition of the MITx's [The Analytics Edge](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+15.071x_2a+2T2015) course (15.071x).

I used only what was taught in the course.

The best approach was #20 (UAC = 0.84915).

I finished in 1046/1884.
